This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is just a simple experiment to build a custom carousel built from scratch using just the scroll snap api.

## Getting Started
To run the development server:

```bash
npm i
# or
bun i
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
bun dev
```
